                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Access to the internet is essential as everyday life requires broadband connectivity to perform daily functions. However, not everyone has fair and equitable access to affordable, high-speed internet. According to the Internet Master Plan, 40% of New York City households lack the combination of home and mobile broadband. The “digital divide” or disparity in digital and internet access is increasingly one of NYC’s most critical indicators of inequality today. Especially in the current climate, New Yorkers need broadband access more so than ever with the COVID-19 pandemic as many have shifted to working from home.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Research Question</h3>
                <p>Where is the digital divide located in NYC and in which neighborhoods is this issue prevalent? Is LinkNYC being used as an effective intervention to help increase internet access in neighborhoods where there are low rates of broadband adoption?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>We first aggregated the Internet Master Plan data by Zipcode to identfiy areas with the lowest home broadband access and neighborhoods with the lowest internet service provider choices. Then, we spatially joined this data to the locations of existing LinkNYC kiosks to assess areas that were lacking in access to this wifi source. To determine whether there is a correlation between certain demographics and where digital divide is located, we ran a regression analysis. We also anaylzed the NYC 311 data to examine what complaints have been filed regarding LinkNYC and if they are a reliable public wifi resource.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Visualizing Broadband Access</h3>
                <p>From our regression analysis, we then identified the top 3 areas that were most vulnerable to digital divide due to lack of LinkNYC: 1) 2) 3) </p>
                <p>Although LinkNYC is being used as a tool to bridge the digitial divide, the deployment of these kiosks is not distributed equitably. LinkNYC alone is not an effective tool that is enough to bridge the gap based off of the 311 complaints received. To bridge the digitial divide, both access and working wifi is required. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Literature Review</h3>
                <p>The Internet Master Plan, released in January 2020 and published by the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (MOCTO), identifies the landscape of internet access in New York City and proposes solutions to close this divide. Through this Master Plan, the City of New York envisions providing internet access for all New Yorkers through five guiding principles: equity, performance, affordability, privacy, and choice. </p>
                <p>LinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that has been employed across all five boroughs of New York City. LinkNYC is the largest, fastest municipal Wi-Fi system in the world and is completely free for all to use. Specifically, LinkNYC helps to serve the millions of people in New York City who don’t have access to high-speed internet. The de Blasio Administration worked closely with each of the Borough presidents to determine the number of LinkNYC kiosks to be installed across the five boroughs to ensure a fair distribution in each neighborhood. </p>
